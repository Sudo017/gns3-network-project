## 📖 Project Overview

This repository contains the complete design, configuration, and simulation files for a **multi-department campus network** built with **GNS3**.  
The goal is to simulate a realistic IT infrastructure that connects multiple departments (Web/Marketing, Supervision, Database, Collaboration, and Internet Backbone) through routers, switches, and virtual servers.

Each team member is responsible for one department, managing its local topology, IP addressing, and services.
