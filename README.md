## 📖 Project Overview

This repository contains the complete design, configuration, and simulation files for a **multi-department campus network** built with **GNS3**.  
The goal is to simulate a realistic IT infrastructure that connects multiple departments (Web/Marketing, Supervision, Database, Collaboration, and Internet Backbone) through routers, switches, and virtual servers.

Each team member is responsible for one department, managing its local topology, IP addressing, and services.

**Departments:**
- 🌐 **Web & Marketing** — Web servers, DMZ, and marketing LAN
- 🖥️ **Supervision / IT** — Monitoring tools (Zabbix, SNMP, Syslog)
- 💾 **Database / Gestion** — Database servers and backups
- 📁 **Collaboration / Share** — File sharing (NFS/SMB)
- 🔒 **Internet Gateway** — Firewall, NAT, VPN access
